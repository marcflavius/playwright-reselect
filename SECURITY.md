Security Policy
===============

If you discover a security vulnerability in Playwright Reselect, please report it privately so we can address it before public disclosure.

Reporting a vulnerability
-------------------------

1. Email the maintainers at: u7081838225@gmail.com (preferred) or open a private GitHub issue and mark it for maintainers' attention.
2. Provide clear reproduction steps, affected versions, and any exploit details you can safely share.

We will acknowledge your report within a reasonable timeframe and coordinate remediation and disclosure.

Note: Do not post security issues publicly; this may put users at risk.
